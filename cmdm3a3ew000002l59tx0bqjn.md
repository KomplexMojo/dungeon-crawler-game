I have been working on various technical projects over a number of years with no record of the exploration. The equivalent is an explorer, exploring new terrain and not creating a map.

I don’t expect this blog will reveal any insights that others haven’t already had, but perhaps my text will help other generate ideas for their own projects.

I pursue software development and technology experimentation as a hobby. I hope the joy I experience in these explorations show through in this blog.

I always explore technology in the context of a project with a purpose it make the exploration real.

My current focus for this exploration is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. The code is here:

[dungeon-crawler-game](https://github.com/KomplexMojo/dungeon-crawler-game)

The the implementation technologies are…

1. IPFS for immutable file content pinning to support maximal decentralization and reduce the need for central infrastructure.
    
2. Blockchain for immutable, source of truth information, and linking to IPFS-persisted files.
    
3. WebAssembly for performance and portability. (I have some really crazy ideas that will need high performance number crunching.)
    
4. AI through (Ollama with a Mistral LLM) to add as my central intelligence.
    

I may add technologies as they arise and make sense, because why not.

I am using ChatGPT as my coding buddy to help me generate ideas and to help turn those ideas into code.
